# Welcome to my personal portfolio!

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, built in a short time orchestrating agents and iterating with Lovable and github copilot.

The website is hosted at: [https://lorenzo-perrier.github.io/lorenzo-perrier/](https://lorenzo-perrier.github.io/lorenzo-perrier/)

It is deployed using GitHub Pages, through a GitHub Action that builds and deploys the site on each push to the `publish-branch` branch.
